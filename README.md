# **Stephen Curry Shot Predictor**
Predicts whether Stephen Curry will make a shot or not based on input (eg. time remaining, shot angle, shot distance etc.)

# **Data**
The data was taken from DomSamangy's repository and altered to produce a csv file with every Stephen Curry shot. 

# **Implementation** 
The accuracy of the best model, which was Gradient Boosting, was 64.5% which outperforms most NBA shot prediction models available on the internet. Different methods including Neural Networks, Random Forest, and SVM were tested with some producing similar results (~64%) 

# **Recommendations** 
Accuracy could rise when considering different features. Adding different features to the dataset would be helpful, such as the proximity of the defender in each shot.
